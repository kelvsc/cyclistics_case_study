# Data Analysis Case Studies

Hello. My name is Kelvin.

This GitHub repository contains sample case studies as part of my data analysis portfolio.

These case studies consist of working with publicly available datasets. I go over how the data is prepared, processed, analyzed, and visualized in a final report. Finally, recommendations are provided. Within each case study, I provide all the queries I used in the varying phases.
