# Introduction

Hello. My name is Kelvin.

This GitHub repository contains sample case studies as part of my data analytics portfolio.

These case studies consist of working with publicly available datasets. I go over how the data is prepared, processed, analyzed, and visualized in a final report. Recommendations, queries, and tools used in the analysis are also provided.
